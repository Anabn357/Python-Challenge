# Python-Challenge
# Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie

## Background

Well... you've made it!

It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. Welcome to the world of programming with Python. In this homework assignment, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete **2** Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.
Both of these challenges encompasses a real-world situation where your newfound Python scripting skills can come in handy. These challenges are far from easy so expect some hard work ahead!

### Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `python-challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for both of the  Python Challenges. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: **PyBank** and  **PyPoll**.

4. Inside of each folder that you just created, add a new file called `main.py`. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.

5. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.
